# PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

## Alogorithm I Used :  MULTI-ARMED-BANDIT

A recommendation engine is a type of data filtering tool using machine learning algorithms to recommend the most relevant items to a particular user or customer. It operates on the principle of finding patterns in consumer behavior data, which can be collected implicitly or explicitly

## Step 1: Data collection
We have used Implicit Data collection

Implicit Data: This includes information collected from activities such as web search history, clicks, cart events, search log, and order history.

## Step 2: Data storage
 Once the data is gathered, it needs to be stored. Over time, the amount of data will grow to be vast. This means ample, scalable storage must be available. Depending on the type of data you collect, different types of storage are available.

## Step 3: Data analysis 
To be used, the data must then be drilled down into and analyzed. There are several different ways in which you can analyze data. These include:

### Real-time analysis: Data is processed as it is created.

### Batch analysis: Data is processed periodically.

Near-real-time analysis : Data is processed in minutes instead of seconds when you donâ€™t need it immediately.

## Step 4: Data filtering

The final step is filtering. Different matrixes or mathematical rules and formulas are applied to the data depending on whether collaborative, content-based, or hybrid model recommendation filtering is being used. The outcome of this filtering is the recommendations.    


# TO RUN PROJECT :

#### Download the zip file and unzip it
then open the folder and enter into the terminal or Code editor what ever we want use

## Make sure that we need to install the below Libraries 

## --Flask

## --Gunicorn

## --Sklearn

## --Pandas

### As it is a PYTHON based project PYTHON must be installed in your COMPUTER






## To install those Libraries use commands as follows :


### For Flask :
```bash
  Pip install Flask
```
### For Gunicorn :
```bash
 Pip install Gunicorn
```
### For sklearn :
```bash
  Pip install sklearn
```
### For pandas :
```bash
 Pip install pandas
```

## Vertual environment should be created

### After installing those Libraies,then in the Terminal use command :
```bash
 flask run
```

## Then you will get into : http://127.0.0.1:5000
